This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is an effort to port the old Macintosh game Continuum to the web using the source code released by Brian Wilson.

Based on the code released by the original authors of Continuum [here](https://www.ski-epic.com/continuum_downloads/)
